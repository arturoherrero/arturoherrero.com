Many projects die before being released, mainly for two reasons:

- They fail to ask the right questions.
- They don't have the courage to ask the difficult questions.

Before a project begins, each team member has a different idea of what the
project is and how it should be approached in order to succeed.

*The Agile Samurai*, by Jonathan Rasmusson, describes the [Agile Project Inception][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

Basically, the book suggests we should consider a series of questions before
starting any project. The idea behind this is to bring the project to its
true essence, defining and communicating that vision between all team members.

### 10 Questions

#### 1. Why are we here?

This is the first and most obvious question. It is a reminder of why we are
here, who are our customers, and why we decided to do this project.

#### 2. Create an elevator pitch

If we had thirty seconds and two sentences to describe our project, what
would we say?

#### 3. Design a product box

If we flip through a magazine and see an advertisement of our product or
service, what would it say? And most, importantly, would you like to buy it?

#### 4. Create a NOT List

We have a clear idea about what we are going to do in this project.
Let's try to be clearer and see what we will _not_ do.

#### 5. Know your community

The community of our project is always bigger than we think.

#### 6. Show the solution

Consider, on a high-level, what architecture and technologies we are going to use.

#### 7. Ask what keeps us up at night

There are a thousand things that could go wrong in our projects. Some we can handle;
others we canâ€™t. This exercise is about making sure we identify the risks.

#### 8. Size it up

Is it a three, six or nine months project?

#### 9. What are your priorities?

All projects have constraints, such as time, money, scope or quality. What are the most
-and least- important things for this project, at this time?

#### 10. How much is it?

How much is it? Who are you going to need for your team?
