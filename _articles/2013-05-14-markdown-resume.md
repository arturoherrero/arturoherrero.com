A few weeks ago I needed to update my curriculum vitae. When was the last time
that you composed your cv? The last time I had to updated it, I was using a
completely different stack. I remember having used Microsoft Office Word.

Now my options are an online editor, LaTeX or [Markdown][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.
I love to write in Markdown and I like to create my own tools so I decided to
craft a tool to do the job.


### biteydown

**[biteydown][2]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}** is Ruby application that turns a simple
Markdown document into a resume in HTML or PDF file.

####Â Instalation

    bundle install

#### Usage

    Usage: biteydown [options] file
            --html                       Create HTML file
            --pdf                        Create PDF file
        -h, --help                       Display help

    $ bin/biteydown --html --pdf example/curriculum.md

#### Style

You can customize the look and feel of text and headings in your document using the `style/style.css` file. First is transformed the Markdown document to HTML file and then apply the style. It's a little bit hacky, but works fine.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed as an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format and then convert it to structurally valid HTML; therefore, CSS selectors can be used to customize the curriculum.

![CV CSS Selectors][3]

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. In this case, there are a little group of selectors that can be used: `h1-h6`, `blockquote`, `a`, `li`, `code`, `strong`, `em`, `img`. You cannot use id or class selectors to create rules that apply to elements.
