description: The ultimate sophistication.

I recently read [Simplifying the Bull: How Picasso Helps to Teach Apple's
Style][3]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, an article that connects how Apple teaches their
designers to strive for simplicity when creating smartphones and other devices
to the way in which Picasso eliminated details to create a great work of art.

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

It is very interesting to see such a clear and visual evolution of a work of
art or a product, trying to eliminate the superfluous and reduce it to its
essence. A designer understands that *"less is more"* and that *"perfection is
finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is
no longer anything to take away"*, although striving towards simplicity on one
level [may increase the complexity of the system on a different level][4].

However, the important thing for me in these cases is the idea of
**iteration**; this applies to absolutely everything, from writing, public
speaking, cooking, designing and programming to business strategy or process.

Being able to do good work involves learning, correcting and improving during
each iteration based on the feedback you get, and every intermediate step is
necessary to reach the final solution.

That's why I believe **iteration is the ultimate sophistication**.
