Hacking is an overused term for a simple concept: to explore the limits of what is
possible doing something in a different way.

For me, writing is simply the act of putting some ideas in order. This is why
I've always tried to focus on what truly matters and avoid all sorts of distractions.

This blog is built with [<s>toto</s>][2]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
[Jekyll][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, a static site generator that transforms Markdown
text into HTML code. It is hosted on [<s>Heroku</s>][3]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
[GitHub Pages][4]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

LiveReload is available during development to automatically reload my browser
when files are modified.

I can't imagine a simpler or better way to write a blog.
