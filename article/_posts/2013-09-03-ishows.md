I'm happy to announce the last project that I participate: <del>iShows</del> **[iShows 2][1]{:target="_blank"}**.

We love TV shows, we love programming, we love design and we believe that we
can create the best TV show tracking app on iOS. Users seems to enjoy the
application and the first version had

![iShows][5]

We wanted to provide an image-based UI and one of the strengths of the app is
the customization of the images. All the credits go to [Luis Recuenco][2]{:target="_blank"}
and [Luis Herrero][3]{:target="_blank"} for the iOS development and UI/UX design.

I developed an image server that provides all the images and is responsible to
make the resize and cropping, so the clients download the images with the
correct size.

iShows 2 is in the [App Store][4]{:target="_blank"}. Enjoy!
