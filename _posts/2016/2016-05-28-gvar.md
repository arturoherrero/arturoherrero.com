I used to have a problem when setting an environment variable; I couldn't make
the variable immediately available in a different shell or subshell without the
need to source any file. As a result, I've created
**[gvar][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}** to solve the problem. This project was
featured on [issue #109 of Changelog Weekly newsletter][8]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

gvar(1) -- display, set, or remove global variables*.

<sup>* When I say global variable, I refer to a key-value pair that you can
read/write at any time in any terminal session. You can think this is similar
to the environment variables because it's a set of dynamic-named values but they
are not session-wide or system-wide related.</sup>

gvar is a pure Bash key-value store where each user has a different collection
of data. The records are stored in the user's home directory as `~/.gvar` file.

By working on this project, I've used the following tools for the first time.


### Bats

[Bats: Bash Automated Testing System][2]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} is a testing
framework for Bash.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bats

@test "invoking gvar VARIABLE prints the value of the global variable" {
  run "$gvar" TEST
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ "$output" = "test" ]
}
```

#### Bats with Travis CI

I usually test my open source projects with Travis CI, but in this case we have
to install Bats, which is not included in the default environment. Here's my
`.travis.yml` file.

```yaml
language: bash
before_install:
  - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:duggan/bats --yes
  - sudo apt-get update -qq
  - sudo apt-get install -qq bats
script:
  - bats test/gvar.bats
```


### Ronn

I was building a command line tool, so I created a man page documenting it.

[Ronn][3]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} builds manuals. It converts simple, human readable *(markdown-like)*
textfiles to roff for terminal display, and also to HTML for the web.

![gvar man page][7]


### ShellCheck

[ShellCheck][4]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} is a static analysis tool for shell scripts.
Since I like to use Code Climate with my projects, ShellCheck gives warnings
and suggestions for bash/sh shell scripts.


### Homebrew formulae

The last thing I did was my own [Homebrew formulae for my packages][5]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.
Now, I can install gvar on OS X without any pain.

```shell
$ brew tap arturoherrero/formulae
$ brew install gvar
```
