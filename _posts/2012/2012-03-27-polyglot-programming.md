title: Polyglot programming
description: Learning different languages allows us to solve problems with the most appropriate language.

Most programmers know several languages. As a web developer, I work on a daily
basis with Groovy, SQL, Bash Scripting, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Learning different languages allows us to solve problems with the most
appropriate tool and to explore new paths of thinking about computational
problems.

Neal Ford coined the term polyglot programming to express this concept:

> I think it's important in this day and age of polyglot programming to
understand a variety of different languages, as they are the design tools we
use to craft software. Just like regular engineers must understand the
physical properties of different materials, we should understand the
capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses of different languages. And when to
apply them.

### Polyglot JVM

Java has long been known simply as a programming language. But today, when
thinking of Java we also refer to a robust and mature development platform.
Currently, the [Java Virtual Machine (JVM) supports over 200 different
programming languages][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

I have been exploring different languages on the JVM—Java, Groovy, Scala and
Clojure—and I shared my experiences with other developers at [Codemotion
2012][2]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}. Hope you enjoy the slides.
