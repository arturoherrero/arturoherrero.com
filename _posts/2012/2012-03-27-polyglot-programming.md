How many programming languages do you know?

Most programmers know several languages. I, as web developer, work on a daily
basis with Groovy, SQL, Bash Scripting, HTML, CSS, JavaScript...

Learning different languages allows us to solve problems with the most
appropriate language and to explore new paths of thinking about computational
problems.

Neal Ford coined the term polyglot programming, to refer about this topic:

> I think it's important in this day and age of polyglot programming to
understand a variety of different languages, as they are the design tools we
use to craft software. Just like regular engineers must understand the
physical properties of different materials, we should understand the
capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses of different languages. And when to
apply them.

### Polyglot JVM

Java has long been known simply as a programming language. Today, when
thinking in Java we refer also a robust and mature development platform.
Currently, the [Java Virtual Machine (JVM) supports over 200 different
programming languages][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

These days I have been exploring different languages on the JVM: Java, Groovy,
Scala, Clojure... I shared my experiences with others developers at [Codemotion
2012][2]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

Hope you enjoy the slides.
