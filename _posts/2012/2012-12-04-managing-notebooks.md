There are a lot of tools to organize and get work done, some are more focused
on task management like ~~Wunderlist~~ To Do, and others are more
focused on project management like Trello.

These are great tools, but I prefer notebooks over other devices and media.
I feel the same way with books and e-readers. I love the feel of paper and it
gives me a better user experience.

In many ways it's more versatile than software because I can organize my daily
tasks, communicate ideas through drawing, sketchnotes, create lists, project
planning, journal, quotes, random thoughts...
