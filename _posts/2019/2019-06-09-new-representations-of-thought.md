> New **representations of thought** — written language, numerals, mathematical
> notation, data graphics — have been responsible for some of the most
> significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity's
> collectively-thinkable territory.

> ##### Definition
>
> A *representation* captures some aspect of a concept or phenomenon in a
> human-understandable form, thereby enabling a person to perceive and think
> about it.
>
> For example, a piece of music can be represented as a verbal description or as
> a page of music notation (*symbolic*); a waveform plot or spectrograph (*visual*);
> an audio recording or click track (*aural*), the pattern of finger movements
> while playing the piano (*tangible*), or the experience of walking around an
> orchestra (*spatial*).

> ##### Parables
>
> * Before the 14th century, multiplication was considered a highly abstract
  > concept, only for the mathematical elite. Once place-value Arabic numerals
  > replaced Roman numerals, multiplication and division became mundane. It was
  > this representation which made universal **arithmetic literacy** possible.
>
> * Before the 17th century, mathematical calculation was described in prose. The
  > invention of algebraic notation made mathematical structure visible, and
  > allowed for abstracting beyond numbers. This representation was the birth of
  > **modern mathematics**.
>
> * Before the 19th century, data was presented in tables. Playfair invented the
  > data plot. Without this form of representation, modern **scientific discovery
  > and communication** would be inconceivable.
>
> * Faraday's representation of magnetism as "lines of force" inspired Maxwell's
  > theory, which he wrote as twenty differential equations. Heaviside invented
  > the language of vector analysis specifically to rewrite Maxwell's equations
  > in four simple lines. This representation was the birth of **electrodynamics**.
>
> * Dalton's elements were a grab-bag, with no coherent framework or predictive
  > power. Mendeleev found a way to represent the patterns of chemical
  > properties with a "periodic table". This representation enabled, for the
  > first time, a theory of **chemistry**.
>
>
> ##### Why representations matter
>
> These representations weren't mere scientific "discoveries". Each of them essentially
> *enabled all subsequent scientific breakthroughs thereafter*. A powerful new form of
> representation affects everything, forever.
