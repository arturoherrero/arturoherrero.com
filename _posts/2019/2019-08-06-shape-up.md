![Shape Up by Ryan Singer][1]

The *Shape Up* method:
- Shaped versus unshaped work.
- Designing at the right level of abstraction.
- Setting appetites instead of estimates.
- Concepting with breadboards and fat marker sketches.
- Making deliberate commitments—bets— instead of feeding the machine.
- Choosing the right cycle length (six weeks).
- A cool-down period between cycles.
- Breaking projects apart into scopes.
- Downhill versus uphill work and communicating about unknowns.
- Scope hammering to separate must-haves from nice-to-haves.
