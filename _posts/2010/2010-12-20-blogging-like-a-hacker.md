Hacking is an overused term for a simple concept: to explore the limits of what
is possible by doing something in a different way.

I want to write and share some ideas, but traditional blogging platforms lock
you into their complex ecosystem. I've chosen to hack my way to a simpler and
more refreshing approach. That's the reason this site is built with [<s>toto</s>][2]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
[Jekyll][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, a static site generator that
transforms Markdown text into HTML code. It is hosted on <s>Heroku</s>
[GitHub Pages][4]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

For me, writing is simply the act of putting some ideas in order. This is why
I've tried to focus on what truly matters and avoid all sorts of distractions. I
can use my [editor][3] of choice, and LiveReload is available during development
to automatically reload the content in the browser when files are modified.
What You Write Is What You See.

Another thing I have always valued is owning the content. My content is
open-source, under [version control][5]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, and
will be accessible despite future redesigns because Markdown is readable as-is.

The effort of blogging like a hacker is worth it.
