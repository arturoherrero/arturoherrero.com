title: Blogging Like a Hacker
description: I can't imagine a simpler or better way to write a blog.

Hacking is an overused term for a simple concept: to explore the limits of what
is possible by doing something in a different way.

In this case, I want to write and share some ideas. For me, writing is simply
the act of putting some ideas in order. This is why I've always tried to focus
on what truly matters and avoid all sorts of distractions.

This site is built with [<s>toto</s>][2]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
[Jekyll][1]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, a static site generator that transforms Markdown
text into HTML code. It is hosted on <s>Heroku</s>
[GitHub Pages][4]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

I can use my editor of choice, and LiveReload is available during development to
automatically reload the content on the browser when files are modified.

There are content management systems that are simpler, but one thing I have
always valued is owning the content. Here, it's open-source, under [version control][5]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"},
and the content will always be accessible despite future redesigns because
Markdown is readable as-is.

The effort of blogging like a hacker is worth it.
