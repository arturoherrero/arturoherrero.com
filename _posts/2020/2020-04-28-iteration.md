I recently read [*Simplifying the Bull: How Picasso Helps to Teach Apple's Style*][3]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"},
an article about how Apple uses Picasso's process of eliminating details to
teach its designers about striving for simplicity when creating their products.

It's fascinating to see such clear visual evolution—whether in art or product
design—where each iteration eliminates the superfluous and reduces the work to
its essence. A designer understands that *"less is more"* and *"perfection is
finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is
no longer anything to take away"*, although striving towards simplicity on one
level [may increase the complexity of the system on a different level][4].

However, the important thing for me in these cases is the idea of
**iteration**. This pattern of iterative refinement appears across industries
and applies to absolutely everything, from writing, public speaking, cooking,
designing and programming to business strategy or process.

Being able to do good work involves learning, correcting and improving during
each iteration based on the feedback you get, and every intermediate step is
necessary to reach the final solution.

That's why I believe **iteration is the ultimate sophistication**.
