I'm happy to announce the latest project that I participated in: **iShows**.

We love TV shows, we love programming, we love design, and we believed that we
could create the best TV show tracking app for iOS. Users enjoyed the
application and the first version had such good reviews.
The second release also had [very][3]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} [good][4]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
[reviews][5]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

![iShows][6]

We wanted to provide an image-based UI and one of the strengths of the app was
the customization of the images. The credits go to [Luis Recuenco][7]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
and [Luis Herrero][8]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} for the iOS development
and UI/UX design.

I developed an image server that provided all the images and was responsible for
resizing and cropping, so the clients downloaded the images with the correct
dimensions. The [iShows server][9] handled over a billion images throughout the
app's lifetime. It was an exciting project to be part of.
