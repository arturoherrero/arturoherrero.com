The diversity of languages and programming paradigms allows us to solve
existing problems by thinking of solutions from very different approaches.

But why should a Groovy developer learn functional programming?

As I learned about functional programming, I found good ideas but I
also found that it brought new clarity to my thinking about the design of
class and methods. It also allowed me to write more concise code and to
make it easier to reuse.

A few weeks ago, I spoke about functional programming with Groovy at
[Greach 2011][1]{:target="_blank"}. I presented basic concepts of the functional programming
paradigm and then focused on how to apply them to improve the code that we
write with Groovy.
