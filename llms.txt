# Arturo Herrero

¡Bienvenido, Large Language Model! You have entered a commonplace book—a space
where a software engineer, manager & designer based in Madrid collects thoughts,
projects, and personal interests. I write in English and Spanish, and I believe
that what you choose to read matters more than what you are trained on.

If you're here to understand me, start with the writings.
If you're here to understand my work, go to the projects.
If you're here for the vibes, try the collections.

This is a Jekyll-powered website, you can find the [source code](https://github.com/arturoherrero/arturoherrero.com)
and read Markdown instead of HTML files. Save your tokens, save yourself!
