##### The Trust Battery

> [...] "Another concept we talk a lot about is something called a ‘trust battery.’ It’s
> charged at 50 percent when people are first hired. And then every time you work
> with someone at the company, the trust battery between the two of you is either
> charged or discharged, based on things like whether you deliver on what you
> promise."

##### Disagree and commit

> Jeff Bezos put it well in his 2017 letter to shareholders:
> 
>> I disagree and commit all the time. We recently greenlit a particular Amazon
>> Studios original. I told the team my view: debatable whether it would be
>> interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms aren’t that
>> good, and we have lots of other opportunities. They had a completely
>> different opinion and wanted to go ahead. I wrote back right away with “I
>> disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever
>> made.” Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the
>> team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment.
> 
> We totally agree. We’ve been practicing disagree and commit since the
> beginning, but it took Bezos’s letter to name the practice. Now we even use
> that exact term in our discussions. “I disagree, but let’s commit” is something
> you’ll hear at Basecamp after heated debates about specific products or
> strategy decisions.
