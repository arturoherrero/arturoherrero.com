> My starting point for this book was not Leonardo's art masterpieces but his
> notebooks. His mind, I think, is best revealed in the more than 7,200 pages of
> his notes and scribbles that, miraculously, survive to this day. Paper turns
> out to be a superb information-storage technology, still readable after five
> hundred years, which our own tweets likely won't be.
> 
> Fortunately, Leonardo could not afford to waste paper, so he crammed every inch
> of his pages with miscellaneous drawings and looking-glass jottings that seem
> random but provide intimations of his mental leaps. Scribbled alongside each
> other, with rhyme if not reason, are math calculations, sketches of his
> devilish young boyfriend, birds, flying machines, theater props, eddies of
> water, blood valves, grotesque heads, angels, siphons, plant stems, sawed-apart
> skulls, tips for painters, notes on the eye and optics, weapons of war, fables,
> riddles, and studies for paintings. The cross-disciplinary brilliance whirls
> across every page, providing a delightful display of a mind dancing with
> nature. His notebooks are the greatest record of curiosity ever created, a
> wondrous guide to the person whom the eminent art historian Kenneth Clark
> called *"the most relentlessly curious man in history"*.
> 
> My favorite gems in his notebooks are his to-do lists, which sparkle with his
> curiosity. One of them, dating from the 1490s in Milan, is that day's list of
> things he wants to learn. *"The measurement of Milan and its suburbs"* is the
> first entry. This has a practical purpose, as revealed by an item later in the
> list: *"Draw Milan"*. Others show him relentlessly seeking out people whose
> brains he could pick: *"Get the master of arithmetic to show you how to square a
> triangle [...] Ask Giannino the Bombardier about how the tower of Ferrara is
> walled [...] Ask Benedetto Protinari by what means they walk on ice in Flanders
> [...] Get a master of hydraulics to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and
> mill in the Lombard manner [...] Get the measurement of the sun promised me by
> Maestro Giovanni Francese, the Frenchman"*. He is insatiable.
> 
> Over and over again, year after year, Leonardo lists things he must do and
> learn. Some involve the type of close observation most of us rarely pause to
> do. *"Observe the goose's foot: if it were always open or always closed the
> creature would not be able to make any kind of movement"*. Others involve
> why-is-the- sky-blue questions about phenomena so commonplace that we rarely
> pause to wonder about them. *"Why is the fish in the water swifter than the bird
> in the air when it ought to be the contrary since the water is heavier and
> thicker than the air?"*.
> 
> Best of all are the questions that seem completely random. *"Describe the tongue
> of the woodpecker"*, he instructs himself. Who on earth would decide one day,
> for no apparent reason, that he wanted to know what the tongue of a woodpecker
> looks like? How would you even find out? It's not information Leonardo needed
> to paint a picture or even to understand the flight of birds. But there it is,
> and, as we shall see, there are fascinating things to learn about the tongue of
> the woodpecker. The reason he wanted to know was because he was Leonardo:
> curious, passionate, and always filled with wonder.
> 
> Oddest of all, there is this entry: *"Go every Saturday to the hot bath where
> you will see naked men"*. We can imagine Leonardo wanting to do that, for
> reasons both anatomical and aesthetic. But did he really need to remind himself
> to do it? The next item on the list is *"Inflate the lungs of a pig and observe
> whether they increase in width and in length, or only in width"*. As the New
> Yorker art critic Adam Gopnik once wrote, *"Leonardo remains weird, matchlessly
> weird, and nothing to be done about it"*.
