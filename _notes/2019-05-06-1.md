My starting point for this book was not Leonardo's art masterpieces but his
notebooks. His mind, I think, is best revealed in the more than 7,200 pages of
his notes and scribbles that, miraculously, survive to this day. Paper turns
out to be a superb information-storage technology, still readable after five
hundred years, which our own tweets likely won't be.

Fortunately, Leonardo could not afford to waste paper, so he crammed every inch
of his pages with miscellaneous drawings and looking-glass jottings that seem
random but provide intimations of his mental leaps. Scribbled alongside each
other, with rhyme if not reason, are math calculations, sketches of his
devilish young boyfriend, birds, flying machines, theater props, eddies of
water, blood valves, grotesque heads, angels, siphons, plant stems, sawed-apart
skulls, tips for painters, notes on the eye and optics, weapons of war, fables,
riddles, and studies for paintings. The cross-disciplinary brilliance whirls
across every page, providing a delightful display of a mind dancing with
nature. His notebooks are the greatest record of curiosity ever created, a
wondrous guide to the person whom the eminent art historian Kenneth Clark
called *"the most relentlessly curious man in history"*.

My favorite gems in his notebooks are his to-do lists, which sparkle with his
curiosity. One of them, dating from the 1490s in Milan, is that day's list of
things he wants to learn. *"The measurement of Milan and its suburbs"* is the
first entry. This has a practical purpose, as revealed by an item later in the
list: *"Draw Milan"*. Others show him relentlessly seeking out people whose
brains he could pick: *"Get the master of arithmetic to show you how to square a
triangle [...] Ask Giannino the Bombardier about how the tower of Ferrara is
walled [...] Ask Benedetto Protinari by what means they walk on ice in Flanders
[...] Get a master of hydraulics to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and
mill in the Lombard manner [...] Get the measurement of the sun promised me by
Maestro Giovanni Francese, the Frenchman"*. He is insatiable.

Over and over again, year after year, Leonardo lists things he must do and
learn. Some involve the type of close observation most of us rarely pause to
do. *"Observe the goose's foot: if it were always open or always closed the
creature would not be able to make any kind of movement"*. Others involve
why-is-the- sky-blue questions about phenomena so commonplace that we rarely
pause to wonder about them. *"Why is the fish in the water swifter than the bird
in the air when it ought to be the contrary since the water is heavier and
thicker than the air?"*.

Best of all are the questions that seem completely random. *"Describe the tongue
of the woodpecker"*, he instructs himself. Who on earth would decide one day,
for no apparent reason, that he wanted to know what the tongue of a woodpecker
looks like? How would you even find out? It's not information Leonardo needed
to paint a picture or even to understand the flight of birds. But there it is,
and, as we shall see, there are fascinating things to learn about the tongue of
the woodpecker. The reason he wanted to know was because he was Leonardo:
curious, passionate, and always filled with wonder.

Oddest of all, there is this entry: *"Go every Saturday to the hot bath where
you will see naked men"*. We can imagine Leonardo wanting to do that, for
reasons both anatomical and aesthetic. But did he really need to remind himself
to do it? The next item on the list is *"Inflate the lungs of a pig and observe
whether they increase in width and in length, or only in width"*. As the New
Yorker art critic Adam Gopnik once wrote, *"Leonardo remains weird, matchlessly
weird, and nothing to be done about it"*.
