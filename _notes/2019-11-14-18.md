description: "Nassim Nicholas Taleb's ideas"
---

I consider [@nntaleb][1]{:target="_blank"}'s ideas and work essential. All his
books are indispensable: *Fooled By Randomness*, *The Black Swan*,
*Antifragile*, and *Skin In The Game*.

Some concepts created or popularized by him:
- Uncertainty.
- Non-linearity.
- Fat-tailed distribution.
- Winner-take-all effect.
- Optionality.
- Convex/Concave strategies.
- Black Swan theory.
- Antifragile.
- Via negativa.
- Ergodicity.
- Lindy effect.
- Skin in the game.
- Intellectual Yet Idiot.
- Iatrogenics.
- Barbell strategy.
- Green Lumber fallacy.
- Intolerant minority.
