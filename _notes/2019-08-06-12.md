[*Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters*][2]{:target="_blank"}
by Ryan Singer. Another great book by the people of Basecamp.

The *Shape Up* method:
- Shaped versus unshaped work
- Designing at the right level of abstraction
- Setting appetites instead of estimates
- Concepting with breadboards and fat marker sketches
- Making deliberate commitments—bets— instead of feeding the machine
- Choosing the right cycle length (six weeks)
- A cool-down period between cycles
- Breaking projects apart into scopes
- Downhill versus uphill work and communicating about unknowns
- Scope hammering to separate must-haves from nice-to-haves
