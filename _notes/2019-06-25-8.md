![La música de los números primos by Marcus du Sautoy][1]

After the complex and fascinating reading of *What We Cannot Know* by Marcus du
Sautoy, I read *The Music of the Primes* (*La música de los números primos*).

On this occasion, he explores prime numbers and the mathematical research that was done on them.
These are some of the stories covered in the book:
- Euclid. Demonstration of infinite prime numbers.
- University of Göttingen.
- Gauss. Instead of predicting what the prime numbers might be, he wondered how
  many prime numbers there are. Notice a pattern – as numbers increase, the
  number of prime numbers decreases.
- Riemann hypothesis. Using the zeta function he constructs a mathematical
  landscape where he connects the distribution of prime numbers with geometry.
  Are all zeros on the same line?
- University of Cambridge.
- Hardy. Demonstration of infinite zeros on the line.
- Ramanujan. Created a formula to calculate prime numbers with a tiny margin of error.
- Turing. Built a machine to demonstrate that Riemann's hypothesis is false.
- Computer. So far, all calculations show that Riemann's hypothesis was correct and all zeros are
  on the same line.
- Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies.
- Montgomery - Dyson. Behaviour of atoms corresponds to the behaviour of prime
  numbers.
- RSA. Factorization of prime numbers.
