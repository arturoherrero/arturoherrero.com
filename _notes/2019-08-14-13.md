description: "Pyramids vs Cathedrals"
---

In many ways, the medieval cathedrals embody what is best about the human
spirit. They were the first man-made structures to go higher than the pyramids,
and this fact alone says a lot about the difference between the Ancient, Pagan
world and the Christian world. A pyramid is a fat structure with a heavy base,
while a cathedral soars towards the sky. A society that builds pyramids is a
society based on slave labor: building a pyramid is pretty much about using as
much raw muscle strength as possible to take many rocks from point A and pile
them up on point B. Meanwhile, a society that builds a cathedral is replete
with scientists, mathematicians, engineers, craftsmen, artists… A pyramid is a
monument dedicated to death–it is a tomb. A cathedral is a monument dedicated
to the triumph over death.
