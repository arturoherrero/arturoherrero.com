![Extreme Ownership][1]
{: .side-image }

> On any team, in any organization, all responsibility for success and failure
> rests with the leader. *The leader must own everything in his or her world*.
> There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit
> failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.
>
> The best leaders don't just take responsibility for their job. They take
> Extreme Ownership of everything that impacts their mission. This fundamental
> core concept enables SEAL leaders to lead high-performing teams in
> extraordinary circumstances and win. But Extreme Ownership isn't a principle
> whose application is limited to the battlefield. This concept is the number-one
> characteristic of any high-performance winning team, in any military unit,
> organization, sports team or business team in any industry.

> "Corporate doesn't understand what's going on out here," said the field
> manager. "Whatever experience those guys had in the field from years ago, they
> have long forgotten. They just don't get what we are dealing with, and their
> questions and second-guessing prevents me and my team from getting the job
> done."
>
> *The infamous they.*

> **The Dichotomy of Leadership**
>
> A good leader must be:
> - confident but not cocky;
> - courageous but not foolhardy;
> - competitive but a gracious loser;
> - attentive to details but not obsessed by them;
> - strong but have endurance;
> - a leader and follower;
> - humble not passive;
> - aggressive not overbearing;
> - quiet not silent;
> - calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions;
> - close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than
>   another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they
>   forget who is in charge.
> - able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command.
>
> *A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove.*
