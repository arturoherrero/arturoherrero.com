The seven liberal arts, are those subjects or skills that in classical
antiquity were considered essential for a free person (*liberalis*, "worthy of
a free person") to know in order to take an active part in civic life,
something that (for ancient Greece) included participating in public debate,
defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and most importantly, military
service.
