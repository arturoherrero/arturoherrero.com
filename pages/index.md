ideas and practices with those around me.

Iâ€™m continually learning and working on [personal projects][8].

I publish articles from time to time, which you will find in the [articles archive][3].

## Reading

Reading is one of my passions, and I keep a [list of the books I read][7].

Another passion is cinema. These are my favorite [movies][11] and [directors][12].
