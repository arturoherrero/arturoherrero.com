¬°Hola! I'm Arturo.

I'm a software engineer, manager & designer based in Madrid. I work at
[GitLab][9]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}. Software is my craft. During my
career, I have had the opportunity to work with remarkable people building
systems at scale and leading technical teams.

This is my commonplace book‚Äîa space where I collect thoughts, projects, and my
personal interests. I publish [articles and notes][3] documenting
ideas and learnings along the way. I also write [weeknotes][14]‚Äîmostly in
Spanish‚Äîsharing snapshots of my life.

I'm constantly working on [personal projects][8]. My journey includes writing a
book: [Instant Markdown][5]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} published by
Packt Publishing, and occasionally [speaking at conferences][6].

I keep track of various collections: a list of [books][7] I've read,
my favorite [movies][11] and [directors][12], my [gaming][13] adventures, and
the [devices][15] I use in my daily life.

You can find me on ùïè as *[@ArturoHerrero][4]{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}*,
or email me at *<arturo.herrero@gmail.com>*.
